# Model-Helicopter-Control

This project contains code which controls the yaw and pitch of the blades on a model helicopter embedded system. 
The program receives user commands to take off, rise to a certain altitude, hover or land, and controls the helicopter blades accordingly.

This was a group project by Yifei Ma, Josh Hulbert and Jos Craw.
